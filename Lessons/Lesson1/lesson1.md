## Git Basic Terminologies
Let us have a look at basics terminologies used in git. To master the tool, you would need to familiarize yourself with the terms involved. 
Let’s get going!

##### Commit: 
Commit Refers to data snapshots. Upon every commit, a snapshot of the look of the file is stored. 

##### Repository:
A repository is the single storage place for all the project work
Working Directory:
Working Directory refers to the directory where there are updates made to the code and this generally refers to the working folder on the local machine. 

##### Staging Area/Staging Index:

A file in the git directory that stores information about what will go into the next commit. The staging area is like a prep table where it will take the next commit. Files on the staging index are poised to be added to the repository

##### SHA: 
SHA refers to a unique identification number for each commit. SHA is a 40 character string command composed of characters( 0 to 9) and (a-f) and is calculated based on contents of files in it. SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 


##### Branch:
Branch is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the main line of development. By default, the straight line of development is called “Master”.
