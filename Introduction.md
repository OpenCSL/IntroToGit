By: [OpenCSL](https://github.com/openCSL)

## What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Controlling version helps in better management and has proved to be efficient and vital in software practices. 
One of the basic examples of Controlling versions is having the same unsaved document prompting to recover itself upon next opening after the sudden closure of document writer applications. 


## Why is Version Control Needed?

 Version control is important for documents that undergo a lot of revision and redrafting and is particularly important for electronic documents because they can easily be changed by a number of different users. These changes may not be immediately apparent

## Introduction To Git:
Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
